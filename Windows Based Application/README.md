For a Windows Based Application, I have created a Scientific Calculator using JAVA(J2SE) with swing API and I have tested this application using JUnit Testing tool.
I have used the code of Scientific Calculator for [alimranahmed's CI-Calculator](https://github.com/alimranahmed/CI-Calculator) and have performed JUnit Testing.
