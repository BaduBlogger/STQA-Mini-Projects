For a Windows Based Application, I have created a Scientific Calculator using JAVA(J2SE) with swing API and I have tested this application using JUnit Testing tool. I have attached an Executable Jar File and a Maven Zipped project with JUnit Test cases and Maven Report.
The Application can be executed by simply executing the jar file or else by opening the project in Eclipse and running the project there.
I have used the code of Scientific Calculator for [alimranahmed's CI-Calculator](https://github.com/alimranahmed/CI-Calculator) and have performed JUnit Testing.
